I've still got a ""Uganda-Kenya"" and ""Alta-Rica"" to try hopefully I like those more. *Update- After reading Colombian coffee especially handpicked perfect beans will produce high acidity coffee and that is what this has to be.

Meh for the hazelnut. ORIGINAL WHITE COFFEE: I had recently finished another brand (Ah Huat) of Malaysia instant white coffee that my aunt had given from her trip to Malaysia so my intention for this purchase was with a given taste profile in mind. Compare to what I was looking for... this came a little short: the flavor isn't as strong/bold and the caffeine level is not even close (on some days that one gave me the jitters). Overall, however, if you're looking for a quick, decent, good tasting cup of instant white coffee, this will do the trick.\nJust pour hot water. Makes it super easy for a lazy morning/afternoon cup of joe or great for traveling because they're individually wrapped/portioned to about 8-12oz (depending on how much water you add but it has enough flavor to uphold the water additions)"",""rating"":""4.0 out of 5 stars"",""source"":""Amazon""}]",,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And as mentioned this coffee is "" BEST BUY BEFORE 12 MONTHS"" First things first , Ya ! The Mug/Cup is Nice . You'll 100% like it after buying . You can't really guess that out from the pics . 1)The description of cup : Curvy body design."" Medium size & cute"" looking with Bright and lovely ""RED"" theme . Thick from 2 ends(*from the open mouth at the top) so as to make more sturdy corners . The grip handle of the cup is huge from top & will not all be painful while holding it . At the same time it gives more protective gripping unlike many other mugs available in market. 2)Coffee taste is certainly not bad as I don't usually buy ""classic "" rather ""GOLD"" . As the aroma and taste of Nescafe gold is much better than this one.\n To be frank, I just bought this for the MUG. I was skeptic about the quality of the mug at first , but now I'am too happy that i bought this Kit."",""rating"":""3.0 out of 5 stars"",""source"":""Amazon""}]",,0,12,57.7,2.6,1.3,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even on bottles I use plastic to cover the opening so as to not let in any air other wise in a week it becomes hard and cant use it.The plastic on the edge of the cover makes sure its a little more tight and blocks more air..

As a self-proclaimed olive enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for good-quality olives to enjoy as a snack or to add to my dishes, and these olives definitely hit the mark.\n\nThe packaging is straightforward and practical. The 450g jar is a decent size, perfect for keeping in the pantry for whenever I have a craving for some olives. The twist-off lid is easy to open, and the resealable feature helps maintain the freshness of the olives after every use.\n\nThe olives themselves are plump and have a nice, firm texture. I appreciate that they are pitted, as it saves me the hassle of removing the pits myself. The brine they are packed in adds a pleasant tanginess to the flavor, which I quite enjoy. They're not overly salty, which is a plus, and the taste is consistent throughout the jar.\n\nI've used these olives in a variety of ways – from snacking straight out of the jar to adding them to salads, pasta dishes, and even pizza. They add a burst of savory flavor that complements a wide range of recipes. The jar size is great for larger gatherings or for keeping stocked up for frequent snacking.\n\nWhile the olives themselves are quite tasty, I did notice a few occasional soft or slightly mushy ones in the jar. While this didn't detract too much from my overall enjoyment, it's something to keep in mind.\n\nIn terms of value, the 450g jar offers a decent amount of olives for the price, making it a reasonable option for olive lovers who want a convenient and versatile snacking solution.\n\nTo sum it up, the Borges Green Pitted Olives in the 450g jar are a flavorful and convenient choice for olive enthusiasts like myself. The plump texture, tangy brine, and versatility in usage make them a great addition to various dishes or a simple snack. Despite a few minor inconsistencies in texture, I'm satisfied with my purchase and would recommend these olives to anyone looking for a reliable option.\n\nPros:\n\nPlump and firm texture.\nTangy brine enhances flavor.\nConvenient packaging with a resealable lid.\nVersatile usage in various dishes.\nReasonable value for the amount of olives.\n\nCons:\n\nOccasional soft or mushy olives."",""rating"":""5"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""Evan"",""review"":""excellent product"",""rating"":""4"",""source"":""Amazon""}]","{""Energy"": 657, ""SaturatedFat"": 0.0, ""Sugar"": 36.0, 'Fiber': 1.0, ""Protein"": 0.0, ""Sodium"": 0, ""Fruit&Nut"": 0}",,,,,,,,Eco-Score not computed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First off I do use a face spf cream to start the day, just because it's part of my routine. But for the rest of the day I use pluxos. It is the perfect over makeup sunscreen. I'm a huge suncare supporter and it is probably the most important thing you can use on your face to keep your skin youthful.\n\nI re-apply every few hours, it's moisturizing and it makes my skin feel the best out of all the sunscreens.\n\nHow can you not love this with all the skincare ingredients built in the formula. It's invisible and gives me a glowy hydrated look.\n\nThe only downside is they don't make a body spf spray or a face cream version for when I don't have makeup on or when I'm at the beach."",""rating"":""5.0 out of 5 stars"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""Naomi Ruth"", ""review"":""As a face sunscreen it does what it says, but as a skin care product it does it even better. The anti aging is working well, I can see the reduction in wrinkles.\n\nI don't really use this for the beach or when I'm hiking. I use it more for when I go out and have makeup on.\n\nI use the cheaper creams on my face when I'm more active.\n\nSince this is a little pricier, I use it when I have makeup and am outside and it's definitely worth it. It goes on invisible and hydrates my face very well.\n\nJust be careful because it is easy to use a lot and it will get really dewy.

Just put it farther away and use a few sprays, also, you'll save a lot more product. \n\nThis face sunscreen spray is pretty much my favorite right now. I had supergoop, but it has too many chemicals. I also like that Pluxos is a small LA business. I saw their product at a popup in LA a little while back. The main thing is that it's essentially a face sunscreen moisturizer/skincare routine.\n\nPros: Face spf47 which is perfect protection for a sunscreen for face, invisible look, sets makeup really well actually, feels like a light mist, smell is a nice eucalyptus, tons of moisturizing ingredients, the vitamin c is great. Last, but most importantly, it goes on over my makeup!\n\nCons: It does smell like a light SPF, but a nice SPF with the eucalyptus. Which is way better than the other brands. But I did wish they made other scents since I love Vanilla and such and maybe that can mask the SPF completely. But I love that their scent is an aroma from the extracts and not a synthetic type chemical scent that most brands use."",""rating"":""5.0 out of 5 stars"",""source"":""Amazon""}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The adjustable ties will even adjust to my locs when they grow to at least mid back length locs. The bonnet is very roomy and the two colors(light blue and black) are both very nice looking. I love that I can pick which color I want for the night. I wear my bonnet around the house all day. It is so comfortable!! The quality is very very good. The satin material is heavenly!!

Thank you for this bonnet. My money was well spent. The one I purchased for myself is Navy/Black. It helps me maintain healthy hair, and it's roomy enough for when I put flexi-rods in my hair and sleep at night. Honestly, this bonnet seems roomy enough for any hairstyle. If you want it to be less roomy, all you have to do is pull the drawstring. If you're wondering if it will be too big without rollers, it's not too big for me. I pin my hair up for bed most of the time and pull the drawstring. It's been over a year since I made my purchase. I wear my bonnet every night. I've been hand washing it on a regular basis, and hanging it to dry. By the way, it dries quickly. The quality of satin is superb! It's still in great condition. Also, they are reversible! I will make another purchase at some point, so I can get one in my favorite color, which is purple! I purchased the Red/Black one and the Blue/Black one to give as gifts and my friends really like them! If you need a great bonnet, do not hesitate to make your purchase. If you already own one of these bonnets, remember that they are great gift items for Christmas, birthdays, etc. Tell everyone about these bonnets and continue to support Glow by Daye!!!  Also, the packaging is cute.  Glow by Daye, you get five stars and a high five from me!  I hope your business continues to grow because you deserve it!

After a brief stint with a retinol cream, my skin in both areas became overtly dry and developed many fine lines prematurely. This added years to my appearance, absolutely not to what I was aiming for! I am already a senior and wanted to age gracefully, just not so rapidly. So I turned to this collagen product as it falls within my affordability range. I was already using L'Oreal products successfully for my hair and cosmetics, so it is a brand I trust. This really does smooth out the many fine lines around my mouth and on my cheeks. It no longer looks permanently puckered, but I have to use it consistently both morning and night as well as occasionally needing to apply a lighter moisturizer during the day when conditions are especially dry. If I get lazy and skip an application, it shows the next day. It doesn't smooth out the fine lines that developed around my eyes, however. They are still noticeable, but are softened within tolerance so I don't use a separate eye cream. The crepe lines that developed on my neck and forehead also soften. I have been using this product for awhile now. One jar will typically last me a month and I will usually order the two-pack. I found that purchasing the two-pack through Amazon saves me money rather than buying this product at the store. That's a win-win to me.

Seriously I am floored!! Just make sure you shake vigorously to mix it evenly.\n\nWow. I think I may have found my holy grail makeup remover! I used it for the first time on a ""full glam"" face as I went to a pretty important event. I'm talking long wear cream eye shadow, long wear 24 hour liquid lipstick, and a double dose of setting pray. The whole nine-yards. And this stuff took care of it all. This bottle (blue cap) is bi-phase, so it has the oil looking stuff (no it's not oil) floating at the top of the bottle. It did not feel greasy, or heavy at all. For my eye makeup I held a soaked cotton round over my eye for a few seconds and I would say 85% of it came off with the first few swipes. Even my mascara. No eyelash loss either. It also did not sting my eyes. Then I did the residual clean up with another soaked piece of cotton. The thing that literally made me say ""WOW"" out loud, was my lipstick removal. I have been wearing the same stuff for years and it stays all day/night with zero transfer, but it can be a pain to get every last trace of it removed. In just three swipes, my lipstick was gone! And no heavy rubbing or scrubbing! I am TOTALLY sold on this stuff! I ended up using it all over my face to remove everything else, and it felt lightweight and clean, but ""a bit much"" for my face. I did use my Simple Brand Micellar to fully clean everything off as I prefer my anti-aging face cream. But I'm sure this would be great for those with dry skin to just leave as is and go to bed.

It makes me cringe to think about how much money I've wasted over the years between Lancome, Cover FX, Clinique and others when this foundation beats those high-end products in every way AND costs a fraction of the price!\n\nFor example, the Lancome Rénergie Lift and Cover FX cream foundations both were great color matches for me, but both required touchups after a few hours even with primer.  I loved the look of Cover FX cream foundation on my skin (the dewy glow), but the transfer was terrible.  The Lancome matched my color but just looked so dull and needed to be touched up all the time too. Estee Lauder Double Wear had great staying power but settled into my fine lines and crows feet, which made me look older.  All of them were expensive, which would be OK if they lived up to their claims.\n\nI literally bought this L'Oreal Pro Glow because I knew I wanted to try a new foundation, but most places are not offering samples during Covid 19. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a high-end foundation that might not be the right color etc.\n\nSo, I watched a lot of great YouTube reviews about the L'Oreal Pro Glow and thought I'd give it a try to just make due for awhile.  Instead, I was blown away with how beautiful this foundation was, the way it gave my 46 year-old skin a healthy glow, it never settled into my fine lines, looked radiant and in tact all day (even without primer), and did not cause any breakouts. I was also impressed that it gave me medium-full buildable coverage and looked great upclose or from a distance...never cakey or heavy looking.\n\nL'Oreal Pro Glow is now my favorite foundation ever, and the fact that it's so affordable is just incredible.  For reference, I am a light-medium skin tone with neutral undertones. My Lancome Rénergie Lift foundation color was 260, and I was N40 in Cover FX.  I have normal skin but break out easily if a product doesn't agree with my skin. The L'Oreal Pro Glo Natural Buff matched me perfectly and made my skin look and feel incredible.\n\nMake sure you shake the Pro Glow foundation first. I've used a beauty blender or a foundation brush to apply, and both methods worked great."",""rating"":""5.0 out of 5 stars"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""Debra blanton"", ""review"":""If you're looking for a foundation that delivers a smooth, natural-looking finish at a great price, I highly recommend trying out this one.

This is the first product I've ever used containing glycolic acid & it has revolutionized my skin care beliefs...because IT WORKS! From the first use my skin felt smoother, supple & pores were less visible. Im pushing 50 & my generation was all about worshipping the Sun- Im talking baby oil mixed with iodine laying on a bed of tin foil people!! All those years have taken a toll on my skin in the form of age spots which makes me look old & tired.\nAfter a week using the Rivitalift Bright Reveal regimen, my skin tone was well on its way to becoming visibly less blotchy. After 2 weeks, the compliments from others began- like, ""Are you losing weight? Did you just come back from vacation? You look so less stressed lately."" Working on my 3rd week, so I'm excited to see the final result at the end of the 30 day Challenge. Right now I can sincerely say, ""I'm feeling more energized because I know I'm exuding a brightness & confidence I had lost!""\nThe Daily Scrub Cleanser used day & night exfoliates the rough, dry skin without the over the top scratching- your-face-off feeling most exfoliators have aling with the glycolic acid with vitamin C & Pro-retinol seems to be brightening my skin right before my eyes.\nNext, the Brightening Peel Pads pads...using these each evening after cleansing. The Daily Cleanser works so well, there isn't much residual dirt left on the pads, but it does make my skin feel extra clean & refreshed.\nThen comes my FAV...applying the Dual Overnight Moisturizer complex. It comes in a cool dual red/white pump that mixes a clear serum with a light cream. I awaken with the same hydrating effects- suppleness & plumpness, as when I initially applied it & it lasts until I cleanse again in the morning.\nFinally, I apply the Day Moisturizer with SPF 30 to prevent additional Sun damage. It is a light, but powerful moisturizer & also contains the glycolic acid to work on vanishing those blotchy spots throughout the day.\nI'm sold already...can't wait to compare before/after pics at the 30 day challenge end! #GotItFree"",""rating"":""5.0 out of 5 stars"",""source"":""Amazon""}]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main reason I went with this brand is price and color availability. I am a brunette and upon reading reviews and my own experience, I knew that I had to go with a lighter shade than my eyebrow or hair color. The referred brand only offered shades that were either lighter or darker than this one (blond or brunette). This one is dark blonde which works perfectly. Its frustrating when you can't return an opened/used product like this, so be careful with the color you choose (I don't want my brows darker than my hair and for some reason I have always found eyebrow products are fairly dark when compared to their color name). Will and have purchased again!","First off I have very blonde and very sparse eyebrows. With no brow makeup they are nearly invisible. I am so self conscious about it that my husband has still never seen me with no brow makeup. I have been using wunderbrow for five years now. That stuff was life altering because I didn’t have to worry about accidentally grazing my brow and the makeup coming off. Decided to try this based on the reviews and it is inexpensive compared to other highly rated name brand brow product. I am now officially converted. Is this perfect? NO. But it is the best I have found for someone who has virtually no brows bald patches in their brow. What I love 1) if you are used to liquid brow makeup this stuff goes on like a F****** breeze. 2) I live in Southern California and when I get out of the shower after exercising on a hot day I find myself sweating straight away (bathroom has little ventilation when AC is on) when I would try to put on wunderbrow with damp sweaty skin it is very difficult to apply. This stuff goes on like a pro, what sweaty skin? 3) after a 30 min run this stuff stays in place (don’t wipe your brow though when sweaty will slightly come off LOL) 4) it applies so fast, my brow routine is now effortless 5) covers my bald patches and often don’t need to touch up with a pencil 6) when I wake up in the morning it doesn’t clump together. Often with wunderbrow I would have to touch up spots that kind of coagulated I guess you could say over night but when I try to go over with a pencil would just make it look worse. Not with this stuff!! This stuff seems to have a stickier formula than wunderbrow making the staying power better. I also love the brush it comes with the bristles are perfect whichever end you use and I like how the spooley makes hair like strokes. THIS IS NOT WATERPROOF. But the best I have tried when comes to getting wet. I don’t think there will ever be a truly water or off makeup. Yes it stays on when wet and through exercise but you still can’t touch it without smudging when wet. Just don’t think you can go off for a swim and except to keep perfect brows in tack.",I have so many eyebrow tints but this one is the best for me.  I use an eyebrow brush to more accurately paint my sparse eyebrows and then use the masacara wand to softly brush it out.  I purchased dark blonde and it’s a great color for me.  I’m ashy brunette with blonde highlights and this color is the best for me.,5,5,4,Amazon,Amazon,Amazon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a tween i began trying everything. From head & shoulders & neutrogena, to higher-priced salon-only shampoos. I've tried raw egg, i've tried an oil i concocted myself from essential oils & jojoba when i worked in a natural bath & skincare store (that helped a lot but was nonetheless OIL and didn't get rid of it fully). THIS SHAMPOO IS THE ONLY THING that works. I'm pretty sure it's the blend of both the coal tar (which I'll grant you, isn't the healthiest solution but it's the one that works), and the zinc, as well as the other essential oil ingredients.\n\nI only use it in the front of my hair. I wet it all, apply a little, then other shampoo to the rest of my hair & rinse. Then reapply & really get it rubbed into my scalp (it of course lathers much better the 2nd time) and let it sit for 3-5 minutes while I scrub the rest of my body, then rinse & condition. i've found i DO have to do it twice, or it doesn't really 'take'. But I never have flakes. Ever. Until I have to wash my hair and I'm without it.\n\nIt IS a little drying to my chemically treated hair, but not bad at all (my hair is long, fine & there's 2 tons of it, so i need all the moisture i can get). But that's why I use another shampoo on the rest of my hair (as well as the fact that it's coal tar, I try to minimize how much of my scalp absorbs that).\n\nFYI the II version DOES NOT WORK for me AT ALL.

I have seborrheic dermatitis and had been using Neutrogena T-Gel and the Target off-brand for more than a year. They were helpful in managing it, but only for a day or two. They definitely did not clear it up for any significant amount of time. So I had high hopes for Philip B.\n\nThe good news is that it works just as well for me as T-Gel. The bad news is that it is more than twice the price and doesn't work any better. So while it was fine, it was definitely not worth the crazy price for me (although if it really works for you, then it's priceless). It smells medicinal, which doesn't bother me, but I know some people hate that.\n\nI am going to try Shea Moisture's African Black Soap shampoo next. Eventually I am going to act like a grown-up and go back to the dermatologist, but for now, I don't wanna.\n\nSo based on the sheer number of glowing reviews, I am not sorry I gave this a one-time shot, even though it is a huge splurge, and I think it might be worth a try for others.

It seems like the product is easy enough to put on and I like that it's organic because that kind of thing is important to some people. It was a little hard to tell how much of an impact it had on my wife. She said she likes it. It tingles while it's on and her skin feels soft and moisturized when rinsed off. It would probably get 4 stars. So why only three you ask? Well, because when it arrived, the seal had already been broken. I don't think anyone used it or anything. I'm guessing it just got dropped or it wasn't a very good seal to begin with. We decided to use it anyway (because we live life on the edge like that) but that may have had an impact on our particular experience.

6598103dc2ee3d587e4bcfdd,Micellar Water 3 in 1 Refreshing,"[{""reviewer_name"":""NYgal"",""review"":""TL;DR: Does what it promises; gently cleans thoroughly without harsh rubbing or harsh surfactants while nourishing & hydrating the skin.\nYou DO need to rinse it off though. The RoseWater & Waterproof ones are the best in the lineup. I’ve finished my second bottle and will be rebuying.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHAS MANY ADVANTAGES & VERY FEW DRAWBACKS\n\nPros:\n•Works\n•Gentle\n•Soothing\n•Affordable\n•No Sulfates\n•No Alcohols\n•No Fragrance\n•Non-Stripping\n•Non-Sensitizing\n•Non-Comedogenic\n•Subtle aroma/scent\n•Nourishing ingredients\n•Doesn’t aggravate acne\n•Doesn’t exacerbate acne\n•Doesn’t irritate my eyes\n•Doesn’t leave much residue\n•Suitable for very sensitive skin\n•Suitable for dry & balanced skin\n•Suitable for oily-dehydrated skin\n•Dissolves oilbased cosmetics well\n•Dissolves waterbased cosmetics well\n•Removes any filth on the skin’s surface\n•Removes any excess sebum on the skin’s surface\n\nCons:\n•Adds less hydration than advertised\n•Removing heavy mineral sunscreens takes effort\n•Waterproof/waterresistant cosmetics takes effort\n•It removes thin ointment like neosporin but it doesn’t fully remove thick ointments, such as, vaseline, aquaphor & cerave healing ointment.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nDOES WHAT IT PROMISES\n\nCompared to the other micellar waters I’ve tried, it does seem to replace some of the hydration you lose from cleansing off your sebum & sweat\n\nAt the end of a day my skin will have some filth, sebum, eyeliner, eyebrow powder, mascara, tinted hybrid sunscreen & pore blurring primer on it.\nIt’s mild unlike harsh makeup wipes that tug at your skin & have tons of preservatives. All I need to do is soak both sides of a thick (“premium”) cotton pad with the solution and wipe with each side to get my face & neck clean. Then I’m ready to rinse with cool water and follow up with either a face wash or a wet microfiber makeup remover cloth (all micellar waters have surfactants that should be washed off the face)\n\nThe first step of my nightly skincare routine. After I finish cleaning I wipe my face with Stridex (toner) pads. The pad is always free of residue so I’m certain that this is cleaning effectively!\n\nNote: The Rose water version will probably only be 4/5 stars for people who prefer to regularly wear very heavy makeup, waterproof makeup or water-resistant mineral sunscreens. Try Garnier’s waterproof version or one of Bioderma’s micellar water.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGOOD FOR VARIOUS SKIN TYPES\n\nMy skin type is combination\nLips & Chin = Dry\nT-Zone & next to the nose = Oily\nRest of the face = Balanced/Normal\n\nso I needed a makeup remover/pre-cleanser that’s compatible  with my entire face and this fits the bill!\nIt sufficiently cleanses my oily areas without stripping the balanced areas and it keeps my dry areas hydrated\n\nI mainly use this on my face & neck and it’s works just as well on both areas.\nMy face is acneic and normal-resilient. My neck is acne-free and normal-sensitive.\n\nI felt the need to test the acidity of this product before saying it won’t sensitize your skin because many people experience irritation or barrier damage from regularly using cleansers & toners. The healthiest skin has a pH no higher than 5.0. It appears this Micellar Rose Water has a pH right between 4.5 & 5.0 (see picture) so you don’t have to worry about it altering your skin’s healthy acidity level.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nA GREAT ADDITION TO THE LINE UP\n\nI’ve tried the “All-in-1 Waterproof” version (Clear bottle, Blue Cap) & it’s the best if you want a deep clean very quickly. IIRC it leaves a bit more product residue, lacks skin nourishing additives & doesn’t hydrate; so it’s not the best choice for everyone.\n\nThe “All-in-1 Mattifying” version (Clear Bottle, Green Cap) I can’t recommend. Acne prone individuals may gravitate towards it because it reduces shine, oil & bacteria temporarily but; none of the ingredients “purify pores” and using tons of denatured alcohol on your face daily is not great for your lipid barrier. People with super oily skin should probably buy one of the other micellar waters and use it as their first cleanser then wash off the residue with a foaming cleanser, benzoyl peroxide cleanser or a salicylic acid cleanser.\n\nThe “All-in-1 Brightening” version (Translucent Yellow Bottle, Yellow Cap) is okay but vitamin c needs to be on your skin for at least 30 minutes before being washed off to brighten skin or lighten pigment and you’re absolutely not supposed to regularly leave micellar water on your face for more than a couple minutes.\n\nThe “All-in-1 Sensitive” version (Clear Bottle, Pink Cap) is the most similar to this one in my experience. I would recommend it for people with sensitive skin that isn’t prone to roughness nor dehydration.\n\nThe nourishing ingredients added to this Rose water version of the product makes it a stand out!\n\nPropanediol is a good humectant & emollient making it good for dehydrated skin conditions. It also boosts the effectiveness of things like salicylic acid.\nGlycerin is also an amazing humectant.\nRosa damascena flower water may have skin conditioning, antimicrobial, antioxidant & anti-inflammatory benefits making it great for both dry & acneic skin.\nCaprylyl/Capryl Glucoside is a good cleansing surfactant for keeping your skin clean but it’s very mild compared to others making it good for sensitized skin.\nSalicylic acid slows how quickly acne bacteria reproduces & purifies the pores.\n\nThe Garnier SkinActive micellar water line up needed this product.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"",""rating"":""5.0"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""NYgal"",""review"":""I bought this to remove my makeup before washing my face.

Rather than try to fill in the whole under-eye area, I dab this stuff on in the deepest hollow of the eye and tap it on with my finger. I don't rub it in but allow it to soak in, and if necessary remove any excess.  I also use this amazing stuff right under my eyebrows and right on top of my cheeks where the top of the cheekbone is.  It lights up my face and makes it look luminous.  I think the trick to this product is that you don't use it as a concealer and don't apply it heavily.  I have tried all sorts of expensive concealers but this light reflector looks better than anything I've ever tried. I also tried it on a friend who is much younger and does not have olive skin but rather caucasian pinkish skin. In her case, I put it under her eyes (she does have hollows even though in her 20s), and also under the brow and on top of the cheekbone.  It gave her a boost of luminosity, and lit up her face."",""rating"":""5.0"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""Eda"",""review"":""This is the only brightener that works to be honest.

The product is in the tube. It is necessary to turn the tube (multiple clicks) to finally get the product to disperse. To me, that's a waste of space and a bit deceptive of the amount of product when looking at the packaging. It is also difficult to dispense the desired amount of product by the clicking system. It is uneven, and one click may dispense excess product, while another click may dispense nothing.\nSince the product is not glittery, shimmery or dewy, it will cake with overpowdering\n\nCons if you're pale and looking for a concealer:\nThis is a nice color match for the extremely pale.\nIt is excellent at covering freckles and minor blemishes.\nFor pale people it won't work as a highlighter, because it will be skin tone.\nIt is ok at covering the undereye area, and I would suggest it as a touch up only.

It's more than a primer: introducing miracle blur, the first-of-its-kind instant skin smoothing finishing cream. Miracle blur was specially formulated with a distinctive cushiony texture that instantly blurs lines, wrinkles, pores and uneven texture. This unique finishing cream blends seamlessly into skin so it instantly looks and feels smooth, leaving a velvet-soft matte finish. A finishing cream in the truest sense, revitalift miracle blur should be the final step in every woman's skincare routine, applied after moisturizer. It can also be worn under foundation for smoother, more even application and wear.  Why is it different? Revitalift's first finishing cream that delivers instant results opti-blur technology diffuses light on skin for a soft-focus effect that instantly smoothes lines and wrinkles, hides pores and minimizes little flaws and imperfections.","L'Oréal Paris is the world's leading cosmetics brand, making the best of luxury beauty available and accessible to everyone.

Plus, it matches most every skin tone. I have some dark coloring under my eyes that I have always had to conceal. This does the trick for the most part. If I wear any concealer, it goes on over the Miracle Blur, and does not take much at all. The Only thing I don't like about it is it can be Too moisturizing, and make your skin oily later in the day. I recommend putting a little on your finger, dabbing it in different areas of your face, then Lightly rubbing it in all over for even coverage. It really does blur fine lines.","I’m a big fan of this product compared to other products that advertise the same benefits. However, kinda high price aside, this is one of the best products of its type. I use it under my foundation. It is enough alone for a low-key weekend, and works well under foundation during the work week. It blurs, it’s sunscreen…it’s very effective. My only qualm (other than the price for the amount you receive) is that if you don’t use the tube fast, this product will begin to dry up. The drier it gets, the less smooth/chunkier it is when mixing to use. This makes it more difficult to apply. Other than that, a fresh tube is tops.","It blended well but felt a little greasy.

After a week the skin was completely healthy and to date: you cannot see where the accident happened.\nMy first bottle is completely empty but I already have another to continue using this wonderful product."",""rating"":""5.0 out of 5 stars"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""Adelynn"", ""review"":""Super product. Absorbs well and no stickiness afterwards. Leave your skin more hydrated. There is no fragrance, which is hard to find these days but a blessing when you do find it, for those with sensitive skin and allergies.  I honestly can’t tell there is a big difference between the collagen and hydration, but both definitely do hydrate. One bottle, used twice a day, about 5 drops each time, lasts me a little over a month. It will probably go longer if you use less but the older you get, the more you tend to slather on a good product. Lol, since it says collagen, I do use that one at night and hydration in the day. I know the collagen production decreases with age, especially after 40, BUT a small part of me want to think it helps a tiny bit.

It gives a gorgeous glow, and I wake up in the morning looking a little bit refreshed! I also use this during the day before I do my makeup and it acts as a good primer as well!

I'm very happy with it so far! The only thing I don't like is the smell...it took me awhile to get used to it, but it's very perfumey and pretty strong. But other than that, I really like it.

So I recently bought and tried this new (to me) L'Oreal Self-Tanning Serum. I like it, but not as much as the L'Oreal Sublime Bronze Lotion. It just wasn't as moisturizing for me. Someone even commented that my legs looked dry. Like all L'Oreal Sublime Bronze products, it's easy to apply, doesn't streak, has a nice scent, and the color is fantastic and very natural. The tan lasts several days, but I don't think the color, at least on me, was as deep as the lotion, even after two applications.

I will make sure i have a back up of this product!  ITS GREAT!!","The smell is not so great, it softens wrinkles and it’s good quality.

The problem is that I have an unhappy combination of flaky-dry skin and deeply oily patches--Clinique's foundation worked okay on the oily bits but was ruinous on the flaky sections, and was actually so impossible that I spent the better part of two years mixing it with my daily moisturizer just to make it workable. (Should have been a red flag, I know, I know.)\n\nI switched to L'Oreal's Lumi foundation thinking I could just return it if it turned out to be truly awful, and if it did work, it was far (far, far) cheaper than Clinique, which would make my pocket book happy. I'm glad I did, too, because this stuff is wonderful. It glides onto my skin, blends beautifully, and works with my dry patches instead of against them. I do get a bit oilier in the evenings than I did before, but that's because this isn't an anti-shine foundation, so finishing powder is a must, but that's a molehill compared to the mountain that was I'm Not Shedding My Skin Like A Snake I Swear.\n\nNot only is this cheaper than my former go-to foundation, but I use far less of it (only one squirt!) and though I've been at it for a month I've barely put a dent in the bottle. And, I'm happy to say, my skin--which is ultra-sensitive and likes to take revenge for things like resting my chin in my hands--didn't react at all. There wasn't even a slight increase in breakouts after the switch and, if anything, my skin evened out more. And true to the name, it really does give you a clean, bright face, a perfect base for whatever look you're going for--and excellent if you're the ""no-make-up make up"" sort, as this stuff is all but invisible when blended with a big foundation brush.\n\nAll-in-all, a really great product--would have gotten 5 stars if I didn't have the Oily Afternoon Syndrome, but that's life!"",""rating"":""4.0"",""source"":""Amazon""}{""reviewer_name"":""Amazon Customer"",""review"":""Sometimes buying makeup on Amazon is dicey, but this foundation has come over and over in pristine condition, no separating, same consistency as in store, but I get a little discount using subscribe and save.

But after using it for a month, I ended up purchasing another set after going through half the bottle.  Since I received and also purchased three different types of Clay Mask which had different purposes, my review will be in three part.  Bear in mind that I would probably rate my skin as about normal with a slight tendency to oily on occasion.","I recommend this product and all the Loreal clay masks and scrubs. It doesn't dry my face out, it doesn't make me break out, and it doesn't give me chemical burns (which I can easily get because of overly sensitive skin). When I use these masks, my face feels very clean and soft afterward. Now, I do recommend that if you are thinking about buying one of these, just buy any clay mask and one scrub. You don't need to buy all of them. I know they all claim to help in different ways, but they all have similar results. Well-worth results, but similar. I would buy the one whose result claim is closer to what you're looking for. I also enjoyed that you don't have to keep the clay masks for son long, just 10 to 15 minutes. The masks will last you quite some time and value to it price. The product itself is creamy to put on. It dries up after 10 minutes and you rinse it off. Your face looks smoother, pores less visible, cleaner, less red, and even acne looks better.

As we age, the skin’s natural ability to renew cells reduces. This in turn causes an increase in melanin production and build up leading to dark spots and dullness. The L’Oréal Glycolic acid serum for dark skin penetrates deep into the skin, stimulates cell renewal, and evens out the basal layer of skin where melanin starts to build up. This serum for uneven skin helps to improve three dimensions of even-toned skin which makes it the best serum for pigmentation and dark spots. It is highly effective, great for daily use and clinically proven to remove five years of dark spots in just two weeks. Dermatologically tested and suitable for all skin types. So, what are you waiting for? Include the L’Oréal Paris dark spot removal serum into your skincare routine right away to reveal radiant and glowing skin at home.","L'Oréal Paris is the world's leading cosmetics brand, making the best of luxury beauty available and accessible to everyone.

There are a few cleansers that don't do this, while the rest of them (generally the new products) do this. I was running out of the Purpose Gentle Cleansing Wash, which was my preferred facial cleanser, then I went to Amazon to order another 12oz bottle, and then I discovered Amazon's horrible ""add-on"" program. I wrote about the various negative features of the add-on program and how I felt about it, on Amazon's forum, so I won't mention it in detail here. Nevertheless, I went to Walgreens to look for the 12oz bottle and found that the price at Walgreens for a 6oz bottle was higher than what I'd even paid for a 12oz one here on Amazon months ago (before the add-on program and it was around $6). So I seen this product on sale at Walgreens for a little over $6 and bought it. The product had a label on it that specified that it was for ""all skin types,"" and that it ""won't dry (the) out skin,"" but the thing that won me over was on the back where it says, ""suitable for sensitive eyes."" Most cleansers burn the eyes when it gets too close, this one doesn't. And for that and the fact that it cleans my skin, I gave it a decent/average rating. Unfortunately, after having only used it for about four days, it also broke me out, more than once and in numerous places on my face. The Purpose face wash didn't do that. It only did it when I wasn't washing my face with it twice a day. This one I washed my face twice and I still broke out. This is the reason why I gave it 3 out of 5 stars.\n\nLet me clarify something for the Amazon community. Generally when I read 3-star reviews of the different products on Amazon, the writers who write them, write pessimistic reviews and discourage the potential customers reading their reviews from purchasing the product or item that they gave a 3-star rating for. A 3-star rating is actually a decent/average rating. Yes, it's neither a 4-star ""good"" rating, nor a 5-star ""great"" rating, but it's still above a 2-star ""below average"" rating, and a one-star ""horrible"" product rating. Decent/Average is still acceptable. It seems like people on Amazon don't know how to rate products. This is a 3-star decent/average product. It does get the job done in washing your face, it doesn't dry out your skin and it is gentle enough to wash the skin under your eyes (where the dark circles may be), but again, it did break me out more than once and in multiple places. This is a decent/average product overall. Would I purchase this again? If I can get my hands on a Purpose bottle for a reasonable price, then probably not, but I'm not going to discourage people from purchasing this because it's not a bad product, it's acceptable."",""rating"":""3.0"",""source"":""Amazon""}{""reviewer_name"":""Jodi"",""review"":""This product is amazing! makes my face look so wonderful."",""rating"":""5.0"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""nancy"",""review"":""I love this product.

This lotion is thicker than most day lotions I have used on my face.  The scent is a little exotic but not bad to my scent-sensitive skin and sense of smell. Problem is it is so thick that it feels like my face has a thick layer over it and it makes my skin bead with sweat easier.  I can't stand to wear makeup over it, since the makeup seems to just float on top of the lotion layer and looks terrible.  Add summer heat and humidity and it makes me feel even hotter.  The day cream of this lotion isn't as bad as the night in regards to the heaviness, but both are not good for hot and humid weather days, especially if you use makeup.

I\nI used it one time & it goes on smoothly.\nIt has a somewhat pleasant smell, has the necessary grittiness that is great for exfoliating. It didn't feel heavy on my face, it just did its thing like this type of mask should do. When I washed it off, my skin was very smooth looking and feeling. It works! And no there was not any white or sticky residue and it was very easy to wash off. I'm still wondering  why some reviews were negative. Its a nice product & yes, it is worth the money."",""rating"":""5.0"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""Sweet T"",""review"":""I'm pretty new to face masks - I'm just starting my routine and it usually involves a sheet mask that probably does more through the placebo effect than anything else. I wanted to give a real product a try so I did some research and read a lot of reviews and I ended up ordering this. I noticed a difference immediately after the first use, and my skin feels amazing every time I use it. (EDIT: added pics. I've been using this mask about once a week for a few months and these are immediate before/after for my last use. You can notice a smoother texture/complexion as well as cleaner pores. This was after an exfoliating face wash.)\n\nRating:\nI'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars mostly because the size of the product is so small. Being new to this stuff, I'm not sure if this kind of size is standard as I could not find a larger version. The rating is also 4/5 because after the first 2 or so uses I haven't seen any other skin improvements. Immediately after every use I can see a change, but no long-term improvements use after use. In other words, I do really like this product and I will probably buy it again, but it was not amazing.\n\nFeel:\nThis face mask doesn't really exfoliate at all. It's supposed to exfoliate as you wash it off but the bits of rock are so few that it doesn't do much. I use an exfoliating face wash instead and then put this on afterward. I have fairly sensitive and very dry skin, so the mask does tingle a bit but it never gets uncomfortable. Once I wash it off my face does feel fantastic - hydrated, plump, and extremely smooth and clean. I do put some light moisturizer on after as my skin is so dry.\n\nResults:\nThe first 2 times I used it I noticed an immediate difference that stayed through the next day. Since then it's stayed about the same - it has shrinked and lessened my visible pores as well as clearing out the big ones on my nose. It has also made my skin tone and texture more even throughout, smoothing the overall appearance. However, even with repeated use (about once a week) it has not cleared out those large pores as much as I would've hoped. Considering how much it did the first couple times I expected it to clear them out much more after a few more uses.\n\nMy boyfriend tried this mask with me once and he was super into it. He almost never washes his face unless I remind him, and after using this he couldn't stop touching his face for hours. He was amazed at how clear and smooth it was. He's Asian American and has what he calls ""Asian grease"" - basically he has fairly oily skin.

Self tanners look awful and fake on my fair skin. They make my skin look even drier. I heard about Lumi and was skeptical it would make me look too dark or shimmery but it looked amazing and the first time I wore it I got many compliments on how great my makeup was. I applied it over primer and under foundation. My skin looks amazing with it! It looks dewy, hydrated, with a warm glow without looking tan or shiny. It brightens my skin with reflective particles that makes my skin look younger with just a slight shimmer. It blurs lines and pores and adds dimension and a natural glow. I'll never do my makeup without it again and will be trying the light, rosy shade also for a different look for winter. This is seriously amazing stuff, especially for older women with dull skin.

My skin DOES feel lightly moisturized and lightly dewy (I love dewy). My skin is still pink (most of my redness is on cheeks), but it is toned down- less purple red, and more of a healthy pinky flush. Red of face is evened out further. The minerals in this is what helps create this effect. The tint is just to keep it from having a white cast.\n\nI use it on clean bare skin. My issue with Karyng products in the past is that they tend to roll/pill on me when used with other products even with a long period of time in between layers, and even with like products (ie water based and water based). My initial experience with this was unfavorable. I had lightly washed my face. Got dressed, then applied this sunscreen. While my face was not wet, it may have been moist enough to react with this sunscreen, as it started rolling. ARGH. This is water based, so there is no need for that. So then I went about my day, and a couple of hours later I added more. Figured, this is what I would normally do, so mind as well see how it does. It did not exacerbate the rolling/pilling. It seemed fine. So while l likely wont be using this directly after washing my face (BOO), and I wont be pairing it with other products (also BOO), I will still use it. Your experience may vary. I haven't tried this under make up (I rarely wear make up0), but when I do I may report back on my experience.\n\nIngredients are listed on box, but not listed here nor on their website.

I was a little suspicious of this, it was a gray piece of plastic that had a small piece in the middle that stuck straight up, so that someone could easily pull it upward and out of the jar, after i did this, i found the black eye shadow underneath it. I don't know if others experienced this or not??... I think it could have been a mistake from the packaging department, they could have accidentally not taken this plastic piece out of the makeup jar, or it could have just been used to take up space in the jar. Either way, it looked like it was used to press the powder into the jar tightly and it pressed it to form the shape of the jar. I felt a little cheated out of my makeup, like maybe it was now half the amount that was originally supposed to be in the jar, however i could not complain because it was half the price as well. So i assumed it was a mistake and kept inspecting my new product. i looked on the outside and it seemed like the same exact jar and size, however, it seemed like there were less sparkles in the black color that i received than the color that i originally saw at the store.Then i decided to take the color and try it on my hand. i took my finger and pressed it into the shadow and swiped it across the top of my hand, like most of us girls do when we want to see what a product will look like once used on the skin, this again looked like it had maybe not less glitter, because there was actually a lot of glitter, but the eye shadow did look less pigmented, or like it was gray, and had to be applied in multiple layers to achieve the black black look to it, and the sparkles seemed to be all silvery, not like the rainbow sparkles i had seen at the store. i am planning on going into the store again, maybe purchasing it there to see if they are the same, or taking the one i now have into the store to compare them., it could just be me, or the lighting of the store versus my house, that threw me off. whatever the case, i am being extremely harsh and critical. because i was only purchasing this color due to the specific sparkle it  had to it in the store, i have plenty of black eye shadow, and i do not need another one. So that is why i am being so judgmental about the specific color. Also, i found it weird for there to be a big piece of plastic pressed up against the powder in the jar that is not visible from the outside. And that plastic piece was not in any of the other ones i had open at the store. Other than those two minor details, this product was great. i loved the color and how it went on, it was extremely sparkly and glittery, it was highly pigmented if u used a lot or put multiple layers, it was almost gel or cream-like, but not. so that made it easy to apply, and it did not crease or flake onto the lower under eye or cheek bones. I showed my mom this product and she was like ""oww, wow that is a beautiful color, look at all those sparkles, i wanna try that!!' So  yes this color is great, the application is great, however i must deduct one star due to the weird plastic thing being in there, and not in the others, and due to my previous viewing of it . when i put it on my hand before, or ""tried it on my skin"" in the store (which i was again not supposed to do... oops.. but how else am i gonna be able to tell, there are no testers?) it went on much easier with a higher amount of pigment, a stronger and darker swipe of black went on easier, and the sparkles were a rainbow/variety of colors, not just all silver sparkles.Either way it is still a pretty color, and i like the consistency of the product itself. It is easy to put on without having to use a lot of the product over and over, maybe 2-3 layers would achieve the color in the jar, and sometimes this is good, so that a lighter color can be applied when blending the color into other colors. I just wanted black with an array of different colored sparkles in it, when in actuality it is a black with silver sparkles, so many that it gives it a metallic gun-metal gray look to the color when it is applied."",""rating"":""5.0"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""S.

I'm not one of those people who has a super strong or easily offended sense of smell (pleasant fragrances don't bother me much even when they are quite powerful), so perhaps this would be too intense for someone who is more sensitive to fragrance, but holy moly this stuff smells aaaahhhhmazing! It's honestly the best smelling shampoo I've ever bought!\n\nWith that being said, although I like the shampoo, but I bought this set specifically for the scalp scrub which I didn't find effective. Again, it smells fantastic (same scent as the shampoo), but the scrubby ground apricot particles just aren't plentiful enough to do anything. Plus, I have long hair, and although it's fine, it was damn near impossible to get this stuff down into my scalp enough to exfoliate at all -- and my hair isn't even that thick. So if you have short hair this might work great, but if it's long (especially thick and long) I'd advise that the scrub probably won't do much for you. You might be better off creating your own scrub via an online DIY recipe using sugar or something of that nature.\n\nAlso, if your main priority is exfoliation and scalp stimulation, I'd HIGHLY recommend getting a cheap scalp scrubber shampoo brush (the little round kind with a finger grip and flexible silicone spikes).\n\nI personally bought this one: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B086SC9NH3?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_mob_b_asin_title\n\nIt was only $2.39 with free Prime shipping and it works great. Really gets down into your roots and scrubs the scalp very nicely, but without being harsh or painful. Gives you the tingles and leaves your scalp feeling super clean. Feels wonderful!\n\nAs for the dandruff shampoo... I don't actually have dandruff (as I mentioned, I bought this duo specifically just for the scalp scrub), but I'm pleasantly surprised by the shampoo. It's creamy, lathers luxuriously, smells freaking AMAZING, cleans nicely, and feels soothing, so I have no complaints. I can't attest to whether or not it stops dandruff, but it contains the proper active ingredient and feels soothing and refreshing, so I have no reason to think it wouldn't.\n\nAll-in-all these are nice products, smell fantastic, and clean nicely, but I just don't find the scrub effective at all.

Using a regular shampoo and conditioner didn't do anything for my dandruff, and it would reappear when my hair dried, with my scalp still feeling pretty bad. I tried this product after a Loreal salesperson handed me a sample at a UCLA event, and from the very first time I tried it, I knew that it worked perfect for me. I've bought this continuously for two years, and I'm only getting around to writing a review now. So, pro: this stuff works!\nThe scent when you scoop some of this stuff out is pretty strong, and I don't doubt it might be unpleasant for some people while rubbing it into their hair. However, I've never really minded the scent, and once you wash it out, it only leaves a faint trace that's way more pleasant. I've gotten compliments on how my hair smelled after using this scrub.  Furthermore, when you wash it out, it de-tangles your hair, so it's like a pseudo-conditioner! However, I still recommend using a conditioner because I tried only using the hair scrub and it made my hair really frizzy.\nThe hair scrub gets rid of most of my dandruff, but to get the rest of it, I also use the everfresh antidandruff shampoo and conditioner of the same line.  So, to be clear, I do hair scrub -> shampoo -> conditioner, and not the hair scrub last. I only use the shampoo on my scalp, and then the conditioner on the rest of my hair and the ends, and I end up with a clean-feeling scalp and incredibly soft and not frizzy hair. I think Loreal really hit it out the park with these products. My only complaint is that I go through the hair scrub pretty fast, but I might be using too much of it each time I shower. Since I have long hair, I have to take big scoops and then spread them out and rub it in slow circles to really cover my whole scalp.

This product has quickly become an essential part of my skincare routine.\n\nFirst and foremost, the fragrance-free formula is a game-changer for me. It's gentle on my sensitive skin and doesn't cause any irritation. This is a huge plus, as I've had trouble with scented products in the past.\n\nThe texture of this face cream is just perfect - it's creamy, yet light, and absorbs quickly into the skin. It leaves my face feeling hydrated without any greasiness. I've noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture of my skin since I started using this moisturizer. It feels smoother and looks more radiant.\n\nOne of the main reasons I chose this product was for its collagen-boosting properties. As I've gotten older, I've started to notice fine lines and wrinkles appearing. After consistent use, I can confidently say that this moisturizer has made a noticeable difference in reducing the appearance of those wrinkles. My skin looks plumper and more youthful.\n\nI also appreciate that it comes in a generous 1.7 oz size, so it lasts a long time. A little goes a long way, so I feel like I'm getting great value for my money.\n\nOverall, L’Oréal Paris Collagen Daily Face Moisturizer has exceeded my expectations. It's a fantastic addition to my skincare routine and has become a staple product in my collection.

I prefer a lighter, more easily absorbed moisturizer, especially for nighttime use.\n\nAdditionally, I didn't notice any significant improvement in my skin after using this product for a few weeks. I had hoped that the hyaluronic acid and niacinamide would help with hydration and skin tone, but I didn't see any noticeable difference. My skin still felt dry, and I didn't experience any reduction in redness or blemishes.\n\nThe packaging is also a bit inconvenient. It comes in a pump bottle, which can be difficult to control the amount of product dispensed. I often found myself pumping out too much or too little, which was frustrating.\n\nOverall, the CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion didn't live up to the hype for me. While it may work better for some people with different skin types or concerns, it just didn't provide the results I was hoping for. I'll be exploring other options for my nighttime skincare routine."",""rating"":""4.0 out of 5 stars"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""Brion"", ""review"":""Love Cera Ve lotions!

My ends were super dry and brittle, but the closer to the scalp you got the oilier my hair was. So I gave my hair a major chop. Going from length of my lower back to above my shoulders. Before I cut my hair, my magical day was 3. I had to wash my hair every 3 days in order to not look gross. When I cut it, it felt amazing, light, pure freedom! My hair was super healthy, I was in love! However, the next day after my vigorous shampoo and cut, my hair was incredibly greasy. AFTER 1 DAY! ONE!!! So I started scrambling, because my hair didnt even make it 24 hours before being a greasy mess, and I had not added anything to it, no oils or anything so I was frustrated. So I did a massive amount of research that landed me on this product. I ordered 2 because its a small bottle. This had changed my hair and fixed my problem. However, since my problem was soooo extreme, what I do is that every 3 days I wash my hair with this 3 times, until its literally squeaky. 3 times, wash, rinse, wash, rinse, wash, rinse. I dont use any conditioner or any other shampoo. Once it makes the squeaky sound, I know I have accomplished what I need to make it last. The last thing I do is place a tiny tiny drop of biosilk silk therapy on my hand, and run it throughout the towel dry hair, this helps keep the frizziness down without weighing down the hair (plus it smells amazing). So long story but this produc saved my hair, i will use it forever..... or as long as i can find it."",""rating"":""5.0 out of 5 stars"",""source"":""Amazon""},{""reviewer_name"":""Debi"", ""review"":""I was on the hunt for a simple multi use soap that would simplify my routine and leave my skin comfortable, because while I enjoy my usual multi product regimen- somedays I just ain’t got time for that.\nThe dove pink bar far exceeds my expectations.

So, gently buff away dry, dull skin while caring for your skin with Dove Pomegranate Seeds & Shea Butter Exfoliating Body Polish. Made with 1/4 moisturizing cream, this exfoliating body scrub restores skin’s nutrients as it exfoliates, leaving your skin feeling silky smooth. With a smooth, easily spreadable texture, this Dove body exfoliator gives you beautifully creamy coverage while releasing the sweet scent of pomegranate. Get all the effectiveness you’d look for in exfoliators or a shower scrub, but with the nourishment and care that your skin needs in the shower. To use, scoop a generous amount of Dove Pomegranate Seed & Shea Butter Exfoliating Body Scrub out of the jar. Massage all over your body in circular motions for creamy coverage, and then rinse away to reveal silky smooth skin. Use 3-4 times per week as part of your skin care regimen, followed by Dove Body Wash or Beauty Bar for touchably soft skin. Try Dove Body Polish to get beach-ready skin, prep skin for tanning, or to help exfoliate before shaving to help prevent ingrown hairs. You'll love the feeling of silky smooth skin all over. Plus, when you buy Dove, you can be assured you’re caring for your skin with products that are PETA Cruelty-Free certified.

Inspired by the white clay benefits found in skin care, Dove Mineral Strengthens Hair Mask helps nourish and strengthen your strands, so you don’t have to worry about damaged hair. Tangle-teasing, heat, UV rays, hair breakage... the list goes on. Our hair goes through a lot that can weaken it and cause hair breakage. This hair mask (or hair masque as some people would call it), for damaged hair helps to nourish and strengthen damaged hair and leave you with up to 99% less hair breakage*. Plus, its nourishing formula is infused with minerals to moisturize every strand, and leave it looking as healthy as it feels. Harnessing the power of white clay, this hair strengthening mask adds a touch of luxury to your daily routine. Apply a generous amount of the Dove Mineral Strengthens + White Clay Hair Mask to mid-lengths and tips. Leave for 3-5 minutes and then rinse thoroughly before drying your hair. After applying the mask generously, take a moment to enjoy its earthy scent while it works on your hair. Time to rinse away? Try using a wide tooth comb. This helps you get a proper rinse and tackle any unwanted knots. After using this hair strengthening clay mask, you’ll be left with tangle-free, clean and smooth hair when you get out of the shower.","Dove is a personal care brand owned by the London-Rotterdam consumer goods company Unilever.

If your skin is feeling dry, you want to build a skin care routine that makes it feel protected from dryness right from the beginning of your day. Dove Dry Oil Beauty Bar contains argan oil, a vitamin E-rich oil that’s known for its moisture-locking properties in even the driest of climates. This dry oil for skin is combined with Dove’s mild cleansers and signature ¼ moisturizing cream and our gentlest cleansers for dry skin. The Dry Oil Beauty Bar gently cleanses and cares for your skin, leaving it feeling soft, smooth and radiant vs. ordinary soap. It's not a soap – it’s a beauty bar. What's different about Dove? Soap bars can cause skin to feel dry, tight and irritated, as some cleansing ingredients strip skin of essential nutrients. Dove Beauty Bars contain gentle cleansers that help your skin retain its natural moisture, and a mild formula that’s kind to your skin. For best results, rub your Dove bar between your hands and enjoy the rich, creamy lather and evocative amber scent before rinsing away with warm water. At Dove, our vision is of a world where beauty is a source of confidence, and not anxiety. So, we are on a mission to help the next generation of women develop a positive relationship with the way they look - helping them raise their self-esteem and realize their full potential.","Dove is a personal care brand owned by the London-Rotterdam consumer goods company Unilever.

66278e28c5e5fa4fe2b14b7d,Maybelline Sensational Liquid Matte Lipstick g Various Colours,Maybelline,Drench your lips in vivid color with a velvety matte finish Liquid matte lipstick designed with x the pigments for intense color,,Health & Beauty,,,,,,,,,,,I absolutely love Maybelline's nude lipstick! It's the perfect shade of nude that complements my skin tone perfectly. The formula is creamy hydrating and applies smoothly. It doesn't dry out my lips like many other matte lipsticks I've tried in the past.nnWhat I love most about this lipstick is that it's long lasting. I can wear it all day and don't have to worry about reapplying it throughout the day. It stays put and doesn't smudge or bleed which is a major plus.nnThe packaging is also sleek and easy to use. The shape of the lipstick makes it easy to apply and the cap snaps on securely so I don't have to worry about it coming off in my purse.nnOverall Maybelline's nude lipstick is a must-have in my makeup collection. It's affordable high quality and perfect for everyday wear. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a comfortable and long-lasting nude lipstick.,This matte liquid lipstick blends well even on dry lips and provides good shade. Transfer proof n smudge proof .,Shade:11 Made easy.A long lasting transfer proof brown shade. Flawless application and gives rich look.,Maybelline introduces another remarkable lipstick which is matte transfer-proof and yet non-drying at a super-affordable price of Rs.349. It gives full opacity with one swipe drying down to a matte within seconds of applying. It is transfer-proof yet feels very comfortable almost weightless and doesnt dry out the lips. Unlike some matte liquid lipsticks this doesnt become crumbly or flake off in pieces even after wearing for many hours.nI apply it with a light hand as the colour deepens after drying. During the day when I dont want an intense look (with this shade) I dot a small amount on my lips and dab it all over for a toned down blotted look which I love. Wears for 6-7 hrs in this weather but requires application after a meal. Unlike the Superstay Matte Ink this is easily removed with plain micellar water and doesnt require a bi-phase one.nnThe biggest con for me is it emphasizes texture & lines on my lips hence the 4*.  This shade also gradually changes colour from a reddish-brown to a pinkish-reddish-brown (hard to describe but the brown tone lessens) after 4-5 hrs. Not sure if its only with this shade or it is because of the lipstick gradually adapting to my natural lip colour. Overall a really good product as its performance is on par with many high-end brands. A transfer-proof yet comfortable liquid lipstick is good for daily wear as well as for special events. This formula would be a comfortable way of wearing deep shades like red.,Super happy with this purchase. Not gonna lie its my fav matte brush lipstick and this shade 'made easy' looks gorgeous on dusky to medium skintone. So all the brown beauties go for it.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Amazon,Amazon,Amazon,Amazon,Amazon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 stars,4.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,maybelline-33.jpeg,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30 AED,AED44.87,,lookFantastic,Amazon,,Amazon,,Was:      AED53.57,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Taniya,ashwini TR,Siddhi,SNirant,Anjali,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Apply lipstick in the center of your upper lip and follow the contours of your mouth\n                                  Glide the lipstick across the entire bottom lip,,https://consumerappimages.blob.core.windows.net/productimages/new/maybelline-33.jpeg

The main reason I have not given 5 stars is that it dries down quite grey. So if youre looking for a jet black liner this may not be the one for you. If youre not worried about it being the blackest black however this is a great choice!,Best liquid eyeliner I've tried.  Nice and thin tip for precise lines and it stays on all-day but also washes off easy when I wash my face at night.

I suffer with really sore dry red skin on my hands this time of year. It was nice to find a hand cream that firstly didnt sting. It went on really lovely and smooth. Highly recommend. My hands are so much better.,For the price this hand cream is fab! My hands get really dry and I find this really helps.,I have dry hands and this hand cream was not too heavy and very nourishing and hydrating.n  Would deffo recommend n  #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,For a cream that doesnt have a rich and luxurious feel to it it worked wonders. Im constantly in water washing dishes and this definitely provided a barrier to the harsh drying out effect of vibrant washing.  Non greasy (which was great) easy to apply non scented and absorbed without leaving a residue. Great product! Fits easily into my handbag and more importantly my budget! #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,I first started buying Aveeno after my doctor recommended it for my children who suffer with infant eczema but now the whole house hold use it. Its made from oatmeal so it helps to moisturise and protect even the most sensitive skin. Its a really hydrating moisturiser that doesnt irritate sore or delicate skin. I love how this makes my hands feel smooth and soft instantly. It soaks in quickly and its not sticky. Its really hydrating so I dont feel I need to constantly re-apply. #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,Definitely recommend this hand cream. In just two days my hands are much softer than normal. It's not sticky at all and you don't need to keep applying it throughout the day to keep your hands moisturised. Amazing stuff. #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,I had Aveeno daily moisturising hand cream to try and was blown away with the results.  I have quite dry hands and have to moisturise several times a day usually. I found that I didn't need to use Aveeno as much. It is a creamy texture and a little goes a long way.  Just pop a dab on the back of your hand (my preferred way) or in your palm and rub into hands . It soaks in quickly and although a bit tacky initially doesn't last long. Definitely left my hands looking younger smooth and hydrated. #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,I loved this handcream. It was very soothing and my normally very chapped and dry hands were smooth and soft after using. I found that they did not feel dry even with repeated washing. #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Today, over 80% of Aveeno® bottles are recyclable.

It gently exfoliates and leaves the skin feeling so moisturised. It's perfect for preparing my skin before my vitamin c serum. If you have rosacea this cleanser may work out very well for you as it doesn't cause any redness sensitivity or dry the skin out.,Soft and gentle on my sensitive sink. Love all their products.,Really lovely and gentle cleanser which will protect your skin barrier.,I have been using the Aveeno Face CALM+RESTORE cleanser for over 2 weeks now and found that it is very gentle to skin leaving it feeling delicate and smooth. I used it at night following the removal of makeup and found that it was the best consistency to do this as it is very smooth and doesn't foam being easy to apply to the skin. It didn't irritate my skin and I did not have any allergic reactions to its ingredients - it is hypoallergenic and doesn't have alcohol in it so is gentle to more reaction-prone skin. At this point I haven't seen any changes - negative or positive - that would encourage me to buy another once this one is empty but this could change after longer use. #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,I had high expectations from this product and this cleanser has a creamy consistency and is supposed to clean and moisturise the skin. I cannot say that its the best cleanser I have ever used. It does not clean the makeupn  well and doesnt moisturise the skin as expected. It might be worth considering as a second cleaner when you apply after cleaning your makeup first.n  #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,I found this face wash extremely gentle. It does not foam which isnt a problem as usually what makes them foam is skin drying. It doesnt have much of a scent. After washing my face with it I feel like my skin isnt properly cleaned hence I only using it in the morning. My daughter on the other hand likes it a lot. She doesnt wear make up and finds that it cleans her skin sufficiently. I have sensitive skin and this product does not dry it out or irritates it. It wont do you any harm but at the same time it wont transform your skin either. #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Today, over 80% of Aveeno® bottles are recyclable.

Not greasy goes on well and my skin feels soft for hours. Definitely recommend.,so many balms bring me out in spots. even though i have dry skin not acne prone skin. it just doesn't like being over occluded. this is so nice provides a protective layer which does the same job as other thicker creams balms i've tried. but sinks in and doesn't just transfer to your pillow. also the only thick cream i would consider for day time use. i like the ingredient list too.,I've always suffered with sensitive & eczema prone skin since birth (now 40). Sadly at start of this year I had anaphylaxis following some antibiotics which did not agree with me. My skin went nuts with this & nothing worked - until this range!! I have now been using every morning & evening - touch wood my skin is AMAZING!!!! Have now restocked ready for when I run out. Highly recommend.,Love this moisturiser! It feels rich on the skin but its actually quite lightweight and sinks into skin quickly. Helps with dry patches and good for sensitive skin!,I was surprised how good and hydrating this balm was. For dry skin I would say the balm is the best moisturiser as the gel one sinks in too quick for me. Cant complain at this price point,I really wanted to love this product and thought the texture would be what it says on the product: a balm. Unfortunately its more like porridge (which I guess makes sense since its oats lol) and its so hard to rub onto your skin. It doesnt blend easily into your skin and it splits and pills even after I let my previous layer completely dry out.nn  I do wake up with really nice moisturised skin the next day but the experience of applying it does put me off from using it.,I had incredibly dry skin on my face! I tried other productsbut this has worked wonders,This product was very luxurious. The packaging is lovely and durable.n  The cream was thick and absorbed well on the skin. It is perfect for winter months especially for very dry skin. I found that it was perfect for overnight treatment. Left my skin silky soft and well hydrated. #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,I have been using Avveno Calm +Restore face moisturiser for around 2 weeks now & have seen a big difference in my skin already. This face cream is extremely moisturising without feeling greasy or oily. My dry flaky patches of skin have disappeared and redness across my tzone greatly reduced. I have been using this on an evening before bed and my face still feels smooth and hydrated by morning! I will definitely be continuing to use this all throughout winter. #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,I can say that I am very happy with Aveeno Face Calm+Restore Oat Rich Balm .I use it once a day.I like it because it doesn't have scent and it moisture my face skin very well.I recommend it  #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Today, over 80% of Aveeno® bottles are recyclable.

I use after using the rest of the Aveeno range and it's very gentle,I've been ordering this cream for many years now as it's the best for my dry sensitive and eczema prone skin. Moisturisers for the whole day and does not trigger my eczema rather calms it. Highly recommend!,I was recommended this by my doctor as I have really bad eczema thats caused by the cold and dry skin and this has helped so much,I guess just an ordinary cream I personally don't like the smell,This is a really delicious cream for regular use on dry skin especially in the cold winter months! It feels rich but not greasy and sinks in very fast.n  It's especially good after shaving and completely eliminates any itchiness.n  There's no fragrance and I really like this because fragrances can be irritating and also clash with perfume etc.n  Overall a superb product that I use all the time.,I am really pleased at how long lasting and effective this lotion is. I apply after a shower in the morning all over my body and it lasts the whole day even over night. It absorbs nicely and leaves my skin feeling soft smooth and hydrated. It also gives it a radiant healthy look which is great. I have patches of dry skin and my skin is sensitive but this lotion is soothing and has improved it so much.,My skin clearly just does not produce enough of whatever it needs to stop it being flaky and intolerable. I've tried so many body lotions over the years that have not worked in any capacity for my skin even really popular dermalogically tested moisturisers. It doesn't help that I can't use anything on my body that has strong scent or alcohol in it without irritating rashing me up. But this aveeno moisturisers? Literally could not live without it. Nothing has combated my chronically dry hands and flaky shoulders arms like this body lotion. I stock up on it whenever I can so I don't run out. I don't know what I'd do without this in the winter.,This is a lovely product to use - not greasy but packs the full moisturising punch whilst been super easy and fast for my skin to absorb. I moisturise twice a day and have found my new go to product!,The perfect body lotion for this time of year! Repurchase consistently.,This body moisturiser is amazingly rich and luxurious.

Hopefully it will help some bumps on my thighs,This body cream balm is amazing! It is a little on the thick side but it absorbs into the skin effortlessly and leaves it so smooth and soothed. I have gone through 3 pots of this now and it's transforming my skin. My skin has never felt softer and I love it's gently enough to use on a daily basis. Aveeno have really done a fantastic job with this product. The lotion version is also very nice.,This is a very thick product it is unscented which I love. I love that it has gentle exfoliating properties.,A little of this super thick moisturiser goes a long way this tub will last a very long time! I was anticipating it to feel sticky after application given how thick it was but found it to absorb quite quickly.  It definitely left my skin deeply moisturised between bathing but found the scent a little off putting (it states fragrance free but has a slight chemical smell to it) a good moisturiser if you have sensitive skin. #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,Packaging is nice and sleek; simple natural palette which reflects well on the product. Easy to open and sealed with foil.nn  The scent is not overwhelming or offensive; quite natural.nn  Although it has a medium to thick consistency the cream is easily to apply and absorbs well. You don't need to wait a long time before getting dressed.nn  I used it straight after the shower in the evenings so it could work overnight. After using it every day for a week I did see a bit of a difference. My skin is a little smoother and my keratosis pilaris is a bit calmer. nn  Jury's still out but I will continue to use it and see how it goes.,I have keratosis pilaris on my arms and tights. I can see it's already reduced after using this cream. My skin feels smoother and more hydrated. I wish the cream would absorb quicker.  #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,I really enjoyed using this. Meant to help rough skin and whilst I cant say it has made a difference just yet it does have a lovely thick texture that is great for parched skin. Will continue to try and see if it helps #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,I loved the fact this was very thick & creamy as it gave it a very luxurious feel and instantly hydrated the skin. Although i wasn't overly keen on the oily residue that it left after application.n  Overall this was a lovely product and very generous filling of the tub too! #HomeTesterClubFreeSample,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Today, over 80% of Aveeno® bottles are recyclable.

While the shingles pain is tough this soak has been a welcome relief. Mum uses it every second day alongside her other medicines and it effectively calms the pain for several hours. It's not a miracle worker but definitely worth 4 stars for its calming effect.,very soothing and makes baths milky could blend a little better as can sometimes clump together but still love and i regularly purchase this!,Makes baths nice and milky and are soothing on skin if you suffer with eczema or even just fancy a nice soak in the bath! Only criticism is they could blend a bit more sometimes it clumps together but really not a problem,Eczema friendly for sure. Better than other alternatives. Follow the instructions carefully and you will be happy with the product.,Tried 3 sachets every time I've changed my approach slightly to prevent clumks but everytime I end up with clumps which is kind of annoying. I don't really think it's helped my skin that much compared to how it felt before using this. Its nice not a bad product I'm just unlikely to repurchase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,LookFantastic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,null,null,null,null,null,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Today, over 80% of Aveeno® bottles are recyclable.
